## A SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) Example App 

The intention of this repository is to demo; a possible way for a medium sized company/project structure
that tries to follow the [SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) to achieve better results in terms of business goals.

To the lower level of architectural decisions this repository leans towards [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), which then relates itself to;

- Hexagonal Architecture (a.k.a. Ports and Adapters) by Alistair Cockburn and adopted by Steve Freeman, and Nat Pryce in their wonderful book Growing Object Oriented Software
- Onion Architecture by Jeffrey Palermo
- Screaming Architecture from a blog of mine last year
- DCI from James Coplien, and Trygve Reenskaug.
- BCE by Ivar Jacobson from his book Object Oriented Software Engineering: A Use-Case Driven Approach

So I haven't really looked, or worked in a project that resembles, deeper into DCI and BCE but I have worked in projects that touches upon the others.


Look at the individual directories' readme files and `.go` files to 
see more details about them.
